# Iridescent
A open-source graphics engine. | Created as a senior project.

### Features
`TODO:` Polish the section at the end of senior project deadline.

I plan to expand and continue this software for assisting and powering personal projects in the near future, although as of now it exists only as a demo, capable of renderring a static triangle with a gradient shader. A docked imgui layer is also present in the demo, showcasing the layerstack implementation of the engine, as well as a log output with proper input polling and event based output. The features present at the moment were a learning challenge for me, and in the roughly 40 hour target that I have to create this engine demo, I learned a lot about engine development, and more specifically low level programming. Other areas of learning include compilation of software with gcc, clang, msvc and build tools such as make and cmake, as well as important data design concepts. Learning resources include Harvard's [cs50](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home), the [hazel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) engine development series, [learncp](https://www.learncpp.com/learn-cpp-site-index/), [opengl](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/tutorials/), and [cmake](https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/) official documentation. Other notable mentions include personal perseverance, stack overflow questions tagged 'segmentation faults', and a ton of passion for software development.

### Demo
To view the capabilities of the engine in it's current state, view the [Demo](https://github.com/timmypidashev/Iridescent/blob/main/Demo/) folder, which contains screenshots of the engine in running order, or download the latest binary in the [releases](https://github.com/timmypidashev/Iridescent/releases) section.
